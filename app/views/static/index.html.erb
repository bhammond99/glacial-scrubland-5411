	<h3>In August of 2014 due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to leave my cushy job with the city. An accident in 2013 left me with back pain that makes it hard for me to sleep. I didnâ€™t know it at the time, but the stress from my job and lack of sleep turned me into a totally different person. Unable to handle the stress of work and everyday life, I began to search for an outlet. That search brought me to coding. After I brief stint at a code immersion camp I arose empowered with a new skill. Join me as I embark on this new life, one full of self-expression through code. Check out my post, leave a comment, and please be sure to subscribe. </h3>
